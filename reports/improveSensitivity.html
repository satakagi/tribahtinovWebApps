<h1>Improve Sensitivity of Tri-Bahtinov Mask</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/620807-tri-bahtinov-mask/">this thread</a> of cloudy nights, an issue on sensitivity of tri-bahtinov mask has been raised. So, this is a study to improve it.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p><a href="../Tri-Bahtinov_symmetric.html">Modified Version (Ver.2) Tri-Bahtinov Mask Generator</a></p>
<img src="TBM_SET.JPG" width="500">

<p>Diffraction gratings colored in the same color makes up a set of Bartinov mask. And the tri-bahrtinov mask is formed by the three colored masks.</p>

<h2>Diffraction images of the Tri-Bahtinov mask with un-collimated optical system</h2>
<p>Note: All the images below are taken with the same amount of un-collimation. The test star is Vega, OTA is C6, the camera is ASI224 MC, and the mask is made equivalent to F.L.=800mm.

<h3>Consideration</h3>
<p>Compared with the original Tribatinov mask, the distance between the oblique gratings(purple) and the horizontal gratings(yellow) is widened. It will contribute to increased sensitivity.</p>
<img src="tbm_stbmV2.jpg" width="480"/>
<p>
<!--The first modified version had a horizontal grating and an inclined pair of gratings equidistant from the center of the aperture.--> And, assuming that the influence of un-collimation is coma, the coma aberration creates aberration due to the image formed by the portion with a different distance from the center of the aperture.(<a href="http://www.openphotographyforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18463">Reference</a>) <!--Therefore it may not have been able to detect coma aberration in the first modified version.--> Therefore, the second modified version made it possible to detect by using zones with different distances from the center of the aperture.</p>
<!--<p>However, if the optical system has astigmatism, it may be possible to detect it even by the first modified version.</p>-->
<p>The reason why the light streak became thick was probably because the length of the grating was shortened.</p>
